            <h1>Seedr.cc</h1>
        </div>
        <h2>an online Torrent leeching website.</h2>

        <p>
            An online torrent client that works just fine in almost every network across the globe. They also torrent
            streaming feature and there are options for non premium and premium users seperately. Seedr.cc is a great
            alternative and a much better user-friendly website than filestream.me and zbigz. You can use Internet
            Download
            Manager (IDM) to download cached torrents from seedr. The best part is that you can delete the torrents from
            the
            server whenever finished downloading, and get your space back for more torrents!
        </p>

        <p>You can buy premium account to further enhance your experience. Then you will be able to download more than
            one
            torrents in parallel, also the size will not be limited to 2 GB.</p>

        <p>Seedr is a next-generation app aiming to bring the torrent experience to the next level.</p>

        <p>Stream movies, music, and books on any device
            With top-in-class streaming technology, Seedr allows you to watch movies, listen to music, or read anything
            in
            your torrent library directly from the cloud on any device.</p>

        <h4> Private and safe</h4>
        <p>Seedr has high-level transport encryption to protect your privacy, and there is no need to worry about
            malware,
            viruses, or outside tracking – Seedr is the barrier protecting you.</p>

        <h4> Very fast</h4>
        <p>Seedr runs on a high-speed backbone and can fetch torrents to the cloud within several minutes down to
            several
            seconds.</p>

        <p>If you’ve ever tried using torrents on either tablet or phone, you’d quickly find out how impractical that is
            .
            Seedr is the solution – with special mobile-friendly protocols we created a snappy, fast mobile site that
            has
            all the functions you get on your PC – including streaming, subtitles and high speed direct downloads.</p>

        <p>We believe that downloading torrents can be friendlier and safer, and plan on expanding the already rich
            features of the site in the near future.</p>

        <h4> Overall</h4>
        <p>Easier to operate than uTorrent (by a long way), Seedr’s beauty lies in its simplicity. It’s hard to imagine
            anyone other than complete novices needing to revert to the site’s tutorial. However, those that do won’t be
            disappointed as it reveals ways to integrate the service into Kodi/XBMC.Free tier aside (which is a steal)
            it’s
            not cheap at $9.95 per month (two months free on annual rates) so the service might benefit from having a
            more
            limited lower-tier premium package around the $6 to $7 mark.
            Those who obsess over the minutiae of their torrenting might prefer a full-blown seedbox experience, but
            Seedr
            knows its target audience and appears to serve them well.</p>

        <h3> Seedr can be tested <a href="//seedr.cc" target="_blank"> here</a> for free.</h3>
